Errors:

ERROR INI

ERROR BCD
        BCD instruction problems.

ERROR 0
        Problems with the Fx65 instruction. Can't load zeroes from memory to 
        registers.

ERROR 1
        System font 8x5 not found. In memory at offset 000h - zeroes.

ERROR 2
        Addiction without overflow (254+1). VF register needs to be set to 0, 
        but after operation it's still 1

ERROR 3
        After operation 254+1, register v0 needs to be set to 255, but it's not.

ERROR 4
        Addiction with overflow (255+1). VF register must be set to 1, but 
        after operation it's still 0

ERROR 5
        Wrong result after addiction operation (255+1). Must be 0.

ERROR 6
        After substraction 1-1 register VF must be 1, but it's still 0.

ERROR 7
        Wrong result after 1-1 operation. Result must be 0.

ERROR 8
        Substract 0-1. VF register must be 0, but it's still 1

ERROR 9
	Wrong result after 0-1 operation. Register v0 must be 255.

ERROR 10
	<Skipped> Please see the source code of SCTEST.C8

ERROR 23
       Can not restore HP48 flags (FX75/FX85 instructions).

ERROR 24
       Check FX1E (I = I + VX) buffer overflow. If buffer overflow, register 
       VF must be set to 1, otherwise 0. As a result, register VF not set to 1.
