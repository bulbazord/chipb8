chipb8
======

A Chip8 Emulator written in C with SDL2 being used to handle input and video.
Audio functionality has not been implemented and there are no plans to
implement them. However, should I feel up to it one day, it will be done using
SDL2 as well.

Dependencies
============

+ SDL2


Building and Running
========

The makefile provided should be sufficient to create this.
Running the code is done like so:

<code> ./chipb8 `<ROM file`> </code>

Thanks to Sergey Naydenov for SCTEST. This ROM can be found on emu-docs/emu-docs.git on Github.
